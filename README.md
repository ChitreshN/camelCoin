## Camel Coin

### Completed

* Complete implementation of the basic chain (Look at commit info for more accurate data)
* Complete implementing basic get and post requests to the server 
* Proof of Work -> Implemeted the proof of work algorithm
* Wallets

### Current focus

* Temporary hold on project
* * core part is done building a block chain on top of this pretty easy, only hurdle might be
    that of the p2p server

### Coming Up [Not anymore :)]

* Look at p2p server again [Might come back to this, but tough sem]

### Deferred to later

* The peer to peer server requires us to open a client side connection, which even after multiple
attempts I'm unable to figure out how
